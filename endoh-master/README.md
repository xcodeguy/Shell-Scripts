This is the endoh entry from the 2012 International Obfuscated C Code Contest.

tl;dr: it does ASCII fluid simulations.

To run it:

- git clone https://github.com/gardaud/endoh.git
- cd endoh
- make
- ./endoh1 < pour-out.txt

You can also `make endoh1_color` and run this binary instead to get colored output.

Have fun :)
