The Big Sleep

Mac notebooks take up to 20 seconds to go to sleep, because they're
saving the state of your RAM to the hard drive. That's a feature called
"safe sleep," and it ensures that if your power is cut, or your battery
dies, your Mac will be able to preserve the contents of the memory and
start you where you last left off. If that's not really a concern of
yours, you can disable safe sleep in the Terminal and make your laptop
sleep in as little as two seconds. Type these commands into the
Terminal, and hit enter after each.

$ sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0 
$ sudo nvram "use-nvramrc?"=false

To re-enable safe sleep, repeat the above, but change "hibernatemode 0"
to "hibernatemode 3," and =false to =true in the second command. Then
reboot.
